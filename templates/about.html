                    <p class="about_p_1 p-5">Babylon was an ancient city in the south of a land known as Mesopotamia, today known as Iraq. It was hub of people, culture and art, known to travellers all over as a paradise of precious harmony. It served as a platform for some of the greatest ideas from religion, politics, art, mathematics, astronomy and so much more. It was revered as a spiritual , consecrated place. Today , the city is an ancient ruin. But its legacy lives on.
                    Babylon Books was formed by a group of like-minded individuals, united by one thing above all others : we all love books. While technology, entertainment and media continues to evolve year to year, books have been and always will be. Whether on a tablet, an ancient hardback or an audiobook, there is something powerful about simple printed text. Ask anyone who has seen a film based on a favourite novel how they feel about both versions - there is a significant chance that  , more often than not, they will say they much preferred the book to the film adaptation. Its not simply because of more content, or a more focused viewpoint of the author - it is the inherent energy, an enchanting glamour, an unspoken dialogue between reader and author. A 10 year old in the year 2023 can pick up Treasuer Island and become just as fascinated with buccaneers, sailing, piracy and adventure as Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson was when he penned the novel. No other form of media can perform this trick. Ironically enough, the power and appeal of books is difficult to put into words.

                    <p class="about_p_2 p-5">"Ok ok, I get it , you like books. Is that it?"  ... Well yeah. But also no.
                        To put it simply, we love books so much, we want to share that passion with the world. That about sums it up, the rest of rambing text is just a sprinkle of theatre darling. Despite my histrionic screeching about how books are so neat, unfortunately less and less people are avid readers. This is understandable, with the rise in phones, computers, social network and other entertainment streams fighting for engagement from the user , it can feel difficult to pull away and focus your attention on something else. Its not easy to remove one's self from the torrent of interactions, updates and information and sit down in a quiet space to get zen with a book. Because thats what reading is - its not just another form of entertainment, the experience of reading is a communicative meditation. You switch off outside distractions, get lost in the pages of a good book , and before you know it , you and Plato are sharing ideas in  a pleasant meditative space, despite exitsting 2300 years apart. This isn't just fulfilling for the sake of engagement or entertainment, reading is also good for you in plenty of other ways. One needn't swing a cat (nor should one, its cruel and cats are friends) to try to hit an article listing the multitude of health benefits that reading every day brings about. Its a known , indisputable fact that reading feels good, its good for you, and there are basically no benefits. While there are less bookworms than ever , its never been more important to read.  So it is our goal , nay, our quest, to share this to promote this gift. to bring more people into this spiritual place - we welcome all into the city gates of Babylon Books. Come in , get yourself a book, grab a stool, put up your feet, have an earl grey tea (with lemon slice) and you have yourself a real good time.</p>

                    <p class="about_p_1 p-5">  So where do we start? Well its not enough to simply like books and tell other people to read them , we want to create a community. And if we could make a few euro to pay rent, well heck - that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world would it? So the plan is thus : we Babylonians come together and start an online community, where we can facilitate books to be sold and provided to customers. We deliberately curate the books available, selecting only the ones that have cast a large shadow on literature , not only because of their influence , but because of the conversation we might foster as result. We want people to engage with the books, think about them, discuss it with their peers , challenge preconceived notions and develop the ongoing discussion. This means that every books you see available for purchase has been hand selected by the founders of Babylon Books. We hope this will lead to more community interactions, genial banter, maybe even real friends ( maybe even real enemies????  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  )</p>
